# Variables

## Theory
variable is representation of actual data. We assign value to a specific variable so we can use it during runtime.
Variable is denoted by $ in bash shell. <br>

In this lab, we are assigning value to a variable and display it. For example, let's assign

*variable* hello to *string* "Hello World"

<br>

### Assigning a Value

**syntax**

> export 'name of the variable'='assigned value'

```bash
export hello="Hello World"
```
![wc](assignv.gif)

### Displaying a Variable

**syntax**

> echo $'name of the variable'

```bash
echo $hello
```
![wc](displayv.gif)


## Instructions

- Try setting up a variable permanently for single user shell.
- Try setting up a variable permanently for global user shell.
